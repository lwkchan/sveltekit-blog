title: 'What I like about Design Systems Engineering'
---

I have been working almost exclusively on Oyster's Design System for a little over a year now. When I first joined the team, I only ever had indirect experience with design systems. Either, I was implementing components as part of a feature. Or, I was informally building a design system - whereby I would make reusable components and push back on design when their new designs didn't really make sense with previous designs.

I wanted to work exclusively on design systems because I really enjoyed working closely with designers and figuring out how to map design language into code. This is still true
