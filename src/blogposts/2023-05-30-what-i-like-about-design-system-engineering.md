title: 'What I like about Design Systems Engineering'
---

I have been working almost exclusively on [Oyster](oysterhr.com)'s Design System for a little over a year now. When I first joined the team, I only ever had indirect experience with design systems. Either, I was implementing components as part of a feature. Or, I was informally building a design system - whereby I would make reusable components and push back on design when their new designs didn't really make sense with previous designs.

I wanted to work exclusively on design systems because I really enjoyed working closely with designers and figuring out how to map design language into code. This is still true. But I've also learned more about the systems-side of design. For example, how it is not always so simple to introduce a new concept to the existing design language. Or how documentation is just as important for designers as it is for developers.

Besides working with designers, I've also really enjoyed working with the wide range of engineers at Oyster. I've always been interested in how communication influences people's ways of thinking and working. I think this is something I picked up when I studied literature at university, or when [I worked in PR](https://www.lwkchan.com/blog/2020-05-08-everything-is-documentation-making-commits-prs-meaningful). I enjoy seeing how people use our APIs (or even how they break them) and how they navigate our documentation (or even if they do at all).

Nonetheless, I was sometimes overwhelmed by the amount of support requests, especially at the beginning; the Design System Team had just started and the notion of a Design System was unclear to the company. Then, when we had a few components, there were loads of questions and bug reports on specific uses of components. The largest thing I noticed was that, whereas before customer support requests were being fielded through customer support or even product managers, now engineers and designers were coming directly to us. On top of this, we were still figuring out the kind of API we wanted to build, how to document our components efficiently and also what kind of workflow we wanted to have as a team

Over time, I've found the following to help our design system and my own working style:
- SLAs on the service requests
- Have an eye on the ground for conversations on how people use components or how they break them
- Invite people to be interested in the DS -- allow them to make PRs if they want! Make people feel like they can affect the design system too
- Experiment with communication styles

I've learned so much about accessibility in the last year than I have ever before.
